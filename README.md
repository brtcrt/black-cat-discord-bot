## About

Bläck Cät is an open-source discord bot that can do almost anything from playing music to games and leveling!

## Goal

The goal with Bläck Cät was simple at first. I wanted to get better at programming and the first thing that came to mind was build a Discord bot from scratch as that was the platform I used the most and also one I was familiar with.

As I learned more and more about programming I decided to make this my main project and expand it as I saw fit. Since than, I have made it my goal to make Bläck Cät the all-in-one bot that can cover any need that a server needs.
