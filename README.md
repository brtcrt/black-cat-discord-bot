<p> Still in development. <br> Nearly all of the features that I want have been implemented. <br> I also re-wrote the whole thing so it had proper command handling. The previous one just had if-else chains which sucked! <br> There are <em>still</em> a couple bugs and I'm actively trying to find and fix them all. </p>
